# zshield-injector
Inject the Z-Shield logic into your bungeecord jar.

Since Z-Shield is handling the player connections itself, your bungeecord jar has to accept special Z-Shield player connections. Make sure your ports are only open to the Z-Shield server.

Usage: ```java -jar zshield-injector.jar```

Please have your `BungeeCord.jar` ready in the folder, the file that is generated will be called `BungeeCord-out.jar`.
